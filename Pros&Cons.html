<h2> Pros </h2>
            <oL TYPE= “I”></oL>
            <LI><B> Reduction in Human Error: </B> AI system would have low error rate compared to human ,if coded properly.<BR>
            <B>Example</B>: In Weather Forecasting using AI they have reduced the majority of human error.</LI>
            <LI><B>Takes risks instead of Humans:</B>  We can overcome many risky limitations of humans by developing an AI Robot which in turn can do the risky things for us. <BR>
            <B>Example:</B> going to mars, defuse a bomb , explore the deepest parts of oceans, mining for coal and oil
            <LI><B> Available 24x7:</B> They don’t need to sleep,rest,take breaks or get entertained . So we can make machines work 24x7 without any breaks and they don’t even get bored or tired, unlike humans.<BR>
            <B>Example:</B> Educational Institutes and Helpline centers are getting many queries and issues which can be handled effectively using AI.</LI>
            <LI><B>Helping in Repetitive Jobs: </B>Using artificial intelligence we can productively automate these mundane tasks and can even remove “boring” tasks for humans and free them up to be increasingly creative.<BR>
            <B>Example:</B> Sending a thanking mail, verifying certain documents for errors</LI>
             
            <LI><B>Can avoid Fraud : </B> The AI system can detect fraud in card based systems and possibly other systems in the future</LI>
             
            <LI><B>Faster Decisions:</B> While taking a decision human will analyze many factors both emotionally and practically but AI-powered machine works on what it is programmed and delivers the results in a faster way.<BR>
             
            <B>Example: </B> We all have played Chess games in Windows. It is nearly impossible to beat CPU in the hard mode because of the AI behind that game.</LI> 
            
<h2>Cons</h2>
        <ol type="i"></ol>
        <p><li><b>High Costs of Creation:</b> As AI is updating every day the hardware and software need to get updated with time to meet the latest requirements. It’ s creation requires huge costs as they are very complex machines.</li>

            <li><b>Making Humans Lazy:</b> AI is making humans lazy with its applications automating the majority of the work. Humans tend to get addicted to these inventions which can cause a problem to future generations.</li>
            
            <li><b>Unemployment:</b> As AI is replacing the majority of the repetitive tasks and other works with robots,human interference is becoming less which will cause a major problem in the employment standards. </li>
            <li><b>No Emotions:</b> There is no doubt that machines are much better when it comes to working efficiently but they cannot replace the human connection that makes the team.
            </li>
            <li><b>Lacking Out of Box Thinking:</b> Machines can perform only those tasks which they are designed or programmed to do, anything out of that they tend to crash or give irrelevant outputs which could be a major backdrop.
            </li></p>
