    <h1>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</h1>
    <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is an area of computer sciences that emphasizes the creation of intelligent machines that work and react like humans. <br> The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.</p>

    <h1>Domains of AI</h1>
    <p>There are 3 Domains of AI - </p>

<div class="row">
    <div class="course-col">
        <h3>Data</h3>
        <p>Data is explained as facts and statistics collected together for reference or analysis. Data is the foundation of Artificial Intelligence. AI techniques are based on a lot of data which the algorithm is trained on to form models. There are 3 types of Data: Audio/Sound Data for Voice Recognition Systems, Textual Data for Automatic Classifying Systems & Multimedia for Computer Vision.</p>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="course-col">
        <h3>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</h3>
        <p>Natural Language Processing, usually shortened as NLP, is a branch of artificial intelligence that deals with the interaction between computers and humans using the natural language. 

            The ultimate objective of NLP is to read, decipher, understand, and make sense of the human languages in a manner that is valuable.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="course-col">
        <h3>Computer Vision</h3>
        <p>Computer vision is an interdisciplinary scientific field that deals with how computers can gain high-level understanding from digital images or videos. From the perspective of engineering, it seeks to understand and automate tasks that the human visual system can do.</p>

        <a href="https://www.afiniti.com/corporate/rock-paper-scissors"><img src="Saved Pictures/Rock, Paper, Scissors.png"></a>
        <h3> Rock, Paper and Scissors</h3>
        <p>This is a game based on Data for AI where the machine tries to predict the next move of the participant. It is a replica of basic rock, paper and scissors game where the machine tries to win ahead by learning from the participant’s previous moves. The software is empowered by Learning Algorithms and is an example of Adaptive A.I. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="facilities-col">
        <a href="https://experiments.withgoogle.com/mystery-animal"><img src="Saved Pictures/Mystery Animal.jpg"></a>
        <h3>Mystery Animal</h3>
        <p>This is a game based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) where the participant has to guess the animal by asking maximum 20 questions to AI. The animal randomly gets selected for each game by AI and the machine replies in either yes or no. </p>

    <div class="facilities-col">
        <a href="https://emojiscavengerhunt.withgoogle.com/"><img src="Saved Pictures/Emoji Scavenger Hunt.jpg"></a>
        <h3> Emoji Scavenger Hunt </h3>
        <p>This is a game based on Computer Vision where the machine initiates the game by showing an Emoji. The participant is expected to show a similar object in front of the camera while the machine constantly tries to guess what is being shown.
